The history of Budapest began when an early Celtic settlement transformed into the Roman town of Aquincum,[15][16] the capital of Lower Pannonia.[15] The Hungarians arrived in the territory in the late 9th century.[17] The area was pillaged by the Mongols in 1241.[18] Buda, the settlements on the west bank of the river, became one of the centres of Renaissance humanist culture by the 15th century.[19][20][21] The Battle of Mohács, in 1526, was followed by nearly 150 years of Ottoman rule.[22] After the reconquest of Buda in 1686, the region entered a new age of prosperity. Pest-Buda became a global city with the unification of Buda, Óbuda, and Pest on 17 November 1873, with the name 'Budapest' given to the new capital.[12][23] Budapest also became the co-capital of the Austro-Hungarian Empire,[24] a great power that dissolved in 1918, following World War I. The city was the focal point of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, the Battle of Budapest in 1945, and the Hungarian Revolution of 1956.[25][26]
